This project explores the global nutrition paradox, where rising obesity and persistent malnutrition coexist across countries, regions, genders, and age groups using WHO public health data (2012–2022).

Data was collected via WHO APIs, cleaned and standardized using Python (Pandas), and stored in a MySQL database. Feature engineering included age group classification, confidence interval width (CI_Width), and severity levels for obesity and malnutrition. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed to identify trends and distributions.

A total of 25 SQL queries were executed within an interactive Streamlit application to analyze global trends, regional disparities, demographic vulnerabilities, and data reliability. The dashboard presents query results as tables and visualizations, enabling data-driven insights into public health challenges.

Key findings highlight increasing obesity trends, persistent malnutrition in developing regions, significant demographic disparities, and varying data reliability across regions. This project demonstrates how analytics can support evidence-based public health strategies.
